# Web-Dev-Final-Project

AI-powered library catalog frontend with advanced search capabilities.

## Changes, additions, notes etc

- Set up the basic home page with header and nav bar
- All three sections of the book cards follow the same format
- I tried implementing the slideshow feature, but couldn't get it to a satisfactory level. The code for it is still included, and I have it commented out for quick changes back and forth.
- Book json data is formatted to the way we agreed upon, with the addition of the book genre
- The chatbot is done with the hovering button feature also agreed upon. Chatbot has no functionality yet.
- Cards are not clickable yet, and nav bar doesn't have any functionality yet.
- Advanced search page integrated with filtering capabilities
